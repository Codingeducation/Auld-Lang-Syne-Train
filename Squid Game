C           G7
Should the game be forgot

    C                F
And never brought to mind

C          G7
Should the despair be forgot

Am          F    G7   C
And days of death and blood 

F   C                G7
For the guards with shape masks, my dear,

    C         F
For Squid Game,

      C            G7
We'll take a cup o'dalgona yet

    Am      F    G7   C
And days of death and blood *gunshot*
